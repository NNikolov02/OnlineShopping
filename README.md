# My Spring Project
# OnlineShopping

The online store must provide the following functionality:

• There should be a search box for the products on the home page. After writing text in this field, the list of products should be filtered. The search is performed on the "Title" and "Description" fields of the products. Use "contains" when searching.
• Regardless of which page we are on, we must have access via a link to the current status of the basket. For this reason, it is good to divide the user interface into two parts - a title bar and a dynamic part. The title bar should contain the store name, logo, login/logout links and a link to the basket.
• When clicking on the link to access the basket, the current status of the basket must be visualized, and the user must be able to edit the contents and. The system must also provide the possibility to finalize (send) the order. The order is sent by writing the customer's email address, physical address and names.
• After sending the order, a confirmation e-mail must be sent for the order and, in case of a desire to register, the user name (his e-mail) and the generated password.
• If the user has a registered profile, he must be able to log in and see all the orders made up to that point, i.e. to have a page for viewing old orders.
• After sending the order, the contents of the basket must be cleared.
